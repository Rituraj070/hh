      <h1>Introduction <br> to <br> <span> The Indian Summit</span></h1>
      <p>
        THE INDIAN SUMMIT is not just a conference designed to bring together
        delegates from around the country to engage in debates on ongoing and
        emerging issues, this conference uniquely aims to celebrate and revive
        INDIAN CULTURE in an era where globalization, epitomized by the
        "McDonaldization" phenomenon, has led to the diminishing of our rich
        cultural heritage.
      </p>
      <p>
        Latterly, there's an urgent need to reconnect with our roots and promote
        our cultural. The Indian Summit addresses this need by fostering a
        platform where the essence of Indian culture is at the forefront. The
        theme for this year, "THE CULTURE SAYS EVERYTHING?", encapsulates our
        vision to enrich and promote cultural awareness through various engaging
        activities.
      </p>
      <p>
        With a mission in confluence with the GREEN INITIATIVE, the Indian Summit
        shall be a completely ZERO PLASTIC event, promoting green initiatives and
        showcasing eco-friendly practices. Our dedication to the environment
        underscores our belief that cultural preservation and environmental
        stewardship go hand in hand.
      </p>
      <p>
        The summit will feature a diverse range of activities designed to inspire
        confidence in emerging minds and encourage public speaking ranging from
        the evergreen heated debates to lightening activities. This initiative not
        only aims to contribute to nation-building through cultural preservation
        and enhancement but also ensuring that emerging carries forward the legacy
        of Indian culture with renewed vigor.
      </p>
      <p>
        Join us at the Indian Summit, where we celebrate the past, present, and
        future of Indian culture and prove that “YES, THE CULTURE SAYS
        EVERYTHING”…
